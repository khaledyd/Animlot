# Animlot
Animlot is a web-based application that offers an interactive and collaborative learning experience for users seeking to learn about new subjects.
It allows users to search for animated videos that explain basic concepts in various topics based on their choice of a keyword and whether they
want to know "what it is" or "how it works."

The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and Firebase for user authentication and file storage.
Material-UI is used to provide a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the application.

Users can also upload and share animated videos with clear explanations, creating a community-driven learning experience.
The platform curates a range of animated videos with clear explanations, making it easy for users to find the information they need.
